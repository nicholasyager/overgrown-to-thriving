# From Overgrown to Thriving: Scaling Your dbt Project Like a Gardener

This repository houses the presentation slides from the session titled "From Overgrown to Thriving: Scaling Your dbt Project Like a Gardener", which I presented at MDS Fest on August 24, 2023.

In this session, we explore the parallels between revitalizing an overgrown garden and maintaining well-organized dbt (data build tool) projects. Just as a neglected garden can become a tangled mess, even the most cherished dbt projects can accumulate complexity and inefficiencies over time without proper care. This presentation provides actionable steps to rejuvenate your dbt projects and foster a culture of long-term sustainability.
